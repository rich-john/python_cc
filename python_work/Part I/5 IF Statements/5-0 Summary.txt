Summary
In this chapter you learned how to write
conditional tests, which always evaluate to True or
False. You learned to write simple if statements, if-
else chains, and if-elif-else chains. You began using
these structures to identify particular conditions
you need to test and to know when those
conditions have been met in your programs.
You learned to handle certain items in a list
differently than all other items while continuing
to utilize the effciency of a for loop. You
also revisited Python's style recommendations to
ensure that your increasingly complex programs
are still relatively easy to read and understand.
In Chapter 6 you'll learn about Python's
dictionaries. A dictionary is similar to a list, but
it allows you to connect pieces of information.
You'll learn how to build dictionaries, loop
through them, and use them in combination
with lists and if statements. Learning about
dictionaries will enable you to model an even
wider variety of real-world situations.
